JDBC notes
RECAP
We need to add mysql connector java dependency

We need 3 things to work with DB
address of DB - url
Name of DB
Username, password -

1) Connection class - to establish the connection with DB
2) Statement class - it allows us to send the query to the DB
3) ResulSet class -  the result will be stored in its object
4) result.next() - ti shift the cursor on to the next line / row
5) ResultSetMetaData class - it contains the information about the result such as how many columns are there,
                             how many rows, name of columns /row etc.

rset - values
rsetmetadata-column
--------------------------------------------
To integrate with framework, we will pass url,username,and password in config.prop file
--------------------------------------------

in order to integrate our DB in framework, we created DBUtility class in Utils package.

---------------------------------------------
"finally" key word = block of code will execute everytime.

select *
from hs_hr_employees
where employee_id='12345';

we have added a scenario in addEmployee feature file
we have added steps in addEmployee Steps page
we have added tag of results


Scenario is to capture the employee id from UI
and verify it with the DB
for this, we have added scenario in feature file
and added in step definitions

then we are verifying firstname, middlename,lastname etc one by one
because we can not compare bunch of values in one attempt






-----------------------------------------
if someone ask you What type assertion you are using.?
- Junit Asseertion.
If a test step fails but you want to keep running other tests,
assertions help. They let you check conditions and continue testing even if a step fails.
This helps you learn more about how the system works and find multiple issues in a single test
